# Pinned mimalloc Rust/C known differences

This is the durable register of observable or algorithmic differences between
the incomplete `crabc-mimalloc` Rust port and exact pinned mimalloc v3.5.0 C.
The source pin is defined in
[`crabc-mimalloc/UPSTREAM.md`](../../crabc-mimalloc/UPSTREAM.md).

## Current status

No ordinary allocation-trace difference is recorded. The current Rust crate contains source-mapped
foundations plus a private, explicit single-thread ordinary-allocation
lifecycle across small, medium, large, and singleton pages. Its small path has
exact address-independent trace parity with pinned C v3.5.0, and a separate
51-key exact differential record covers the bounded fundamental page-kind,
calloc, realloc, aligned/offset-aligned, usable-size, preservation, and failure
slice. This includes live arena-backed alignment through 64 KiB and separately
owned OS-aligned singleton mappings below 256 MiB. The lifecycle is not
exported and does not imply parity for the absent process/TLS, remote-free,
teardown, purge, or public-API regions. The private regular-TLS and
subprocess-attached/no-theap TLD owners record one internal recovery limitation
in the source map:
`MetaAllocator::free` may report an error after consuming a capability. The
regular owner clears its dynamic root, while the TLD owner has already
invalidated `thread_id`; each terminally poisons rather than retaining a
capability that could name freed storage. This state is not a valid C-program
observable difference and has no C differential entry; a richer metadata-free
result may refine it only when it can prove retained ownership.

### `CRABC-MI-RANDOM-WEAK-EXPANSION` — accepted degraded-entropy substitution

- **Upstream/Rust:** `src/random.c:_mi_os_random_weak` and
  `mi_random_init_ex` / `random::WeakObservations::expand_into`.
- **Category:** allocator random-state behavior only after `getrandom` errors
  or short reads; it has no C ABI surface and is not part of the deterministic
  allocation traces.
- **Difference:** pinned C repeatedly applies its local
  `_mi_random_shuffle` core to ASLR/time material. The project crypto policy
  forbids maintaining that PRNG/DRBG core. Rust serializes the same degraded
  context-address/time/identity observations plus the source extra seed, then
  asks approved RustCrypto `ChaCha20LegacyCore` for one domain-separated block
  to form the weak key. It preserves the source continuation, weak flag,
  reinitialization, and original-ChaCha context lifecycle; it does not claim
  to add entropy.
- **Evidence:** `random::tests::weak_observations_have_a_dependency_owned_deterministic_expansion`
  fixes the replacement vector. The entropy fault regression proves error
  continuation and weak reinitialization; the direct primitive contract treats
  a short read as `Ok(false)` on that same branch. Exact C output comparison is
  intentionally inapplicable because both source paths consume ASLR/time and
  no random cookie is a deterministic valid-program oracle. Performance is
  unqualified while the theap is unpublished.
- **Decision/removal:** accepted because the source-local cryptographic core
  cannot enter this repository. It remains until the pinned upstream changes
  its weak path or the project crypto boundary is explicitly changed; it does
  not authorize a local replacement implementation.

## Entry requirements

Each entry must state:

- a stable difference identifier and status (`observed`, `pending`, `accepted`,
  or `rejected`);
- the upstream source path/function or type and the Rust module/function;
- whether the difference affects engine semantics, C ABI integration,
  configuration, performance, diagnostics, or invalid-use handling;
- a minimal reproducer and exact-C differential result for valid programs;
- its written design note, when it is algorithmic or behavioral;
- Linux/AArch64 performance and memory evidence; and
- the decision and conditions that would remove the difference.

`crabc-libc` ownership of C ABI and `errno`, and direct crabc lifecycle wiring
for threads and fork, are integration boundaries rather than implicit
differences. They still require tests. Invalid use must not be copied merely to
reproduce C memory unsafety; document a deliberate safe difference here if one
is necessary.

An entry cannot replace the exact pinned C implementation as a differential
oracle or justify a runtime fallback. Accepted differences require the design,
differential, and performance evidence specified in
[`docs/design/allocator.md`](../../docs/design/allocator.md).
