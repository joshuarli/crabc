//! Private crabc-runtime lifecycle bridge.
//!
//! This module is the one direct Rust boundary used by `crabc-libc` while the
//! C mimalloc backend remains the production allocator. It retains the
//! source-shaped ticket-zero `ProcessMainThread` and the main-thread-minted
//! `MainStaticHeapLease` for the process lifetime, then places one no-page
//! `MainHeapThreadAttachment` in compiler TLS for each pthread worker that
//! successfully enters through the runtime. The worker finishes only after
//! libc has run user cleanup handlers and pthread TSD destructors.
//!
//! It deliberately does not route any `malloc`/`free` call, expose a C symbol,
//! select a backend, create a public pthread key, or claim fork recovery. A
//! failed process setup leaves this shadow lifecycle unavailable and preserves
//! the C backend. A failed worker attachment prevents that worker's start
//! routine from running; libc performs the parent/child startup handshake. A
//! post-fork child only disables this incomplete lifecycle without traversing
//! inherited locks, roots, or page state.
